# Changelog

All notable changes to the **The Crystalline Worldsheet** manuscript and
verification suite are recorded here.

The format follows [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/);
release-it generates the per-version section headers automatically from the
commit messages, so only the *Unreleased* section is hand-curated.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Initial manuscript sources (`src/chapters/`) split from the integrated
  preprint `CW3_paper_integrado_nuevo_s4.tex` (single-section monolithic
  predecessor).
- Lean 4 / Mathlib backing `lean/CW3_Backing.lean` (113 `\Lean{...}` tags).
- Numerical backing `tests/CW3_backing_verify.py` (one `[OK]/[FAIL]` line
  per cited equation label).
- Figure generator `scripts/figures/CW3_all_figures.py` (six publication
  figures).

### Notes

- This release preserves the deliverables from the author for placement
  into the project shell; no editorial or scientific content has been added
  or removed.
